<p>Project Meshnet aims to build a sustainable decentralized alternative internet. You can help in several ways from spreading the word, starting up your first <a href="https://wiki.projectmeshnet.org/Cjdns">Cjdns</a> node, or starting a local meshnet group.</p>

<h3>
<a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Project Meshnet</h3>

<p>Project Meshnet was created out of the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/darknetplan">/r/darknetplan</a> community in order to fight back against Internet censorship by corporations and governments around the world. It aims to use a combination of software and hardware to achieve the goal of a censorship-free Internet. The software component, called Cjdns, is being used right now to create a network called Hyperboria. Hyperboria is a network that operates securely over the current Internet infrastructure. Along with this network, Project Meshnet is also working to help setup hardware installations in communities around the globe, creating mesh "islands", which will then tie into Hyperboria. These mesh islands are completely immune to any form of censorship.</p>
<p>Project Meshnet can mostly be helped right now by those with a medium to high level of skill with the technologies involved. Both the software and hardware packages are in the very early Alpha stages and need as much assistance as possible to get off the ground. However, if you are not tech-savvy but can find a tech-savvy user to work with, you should still be able to contribute substantially to the project. Below you will find a guide on how to best assist the project and further its goals. It should help you find both hardware and instruct you in installing Cjdns.</p>

<a name="step1" class="anchor" href="#step1"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step one: Get on IRC</h3>

<p>This is the most important part, we are social people and like to talk, helping people and discussing the latest topics is way easier on the IRC than anything else. Don't be shy. Introduce yourself. You can find us on <a href="irc://irc.efnet.org/#projectmeshnet">EFNet's #projectmeshnet channel</a> or use the <a href="http://chat.efnet.org:9090/?channels=%23projectmeshnet&nick=wikiuser..">webchat</a>.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
